        <p>Kata Containers is an open source project and community working to build a standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that feel and perform like containers, but provide the workload isolation and security advantages of VMs.</p>
        <p>The Kata Containers project has six components: Agent, Runtime, Proxy, Shim, Kernel and packaging of QEMU 2.11. It is designed to be architecture agnostic, run on multiple hypervisors and be compatible with the OCI specification for Docker containers and CRI for Kubernetes.</p>
        <p>Kata Containers combines technology from IntelÂ® Clear Containers and Hyper runV. The code is hosted on Github under the Apache 2 license and the project is managed by the OpenStack Foundation.</p>
