          <div class="desc">Today, we are very happy to announce Hyper.sh (beta), which you can try out for free. We’ve been working on Hyper.sh for a long time and we’re now ready to unleash it on the world!. Different from traditional container services, Hyper.sh is a native container cloud, in which multi-tenant containers can inherently be run safely side by side on bare metal, instead of being nested in VMs.</div>

          <div class="desc">However, most multi-tenant CaaS solutions today run on a public IaaS, and use fully isolated virtual machine clusters to schedule containers. This is in contrast to the solely container-based implementation provided in private CaaS deployments. The public “hybrid” VM/container isolation approach is a direct result from the shared kernel architecture in container technology.</div>
